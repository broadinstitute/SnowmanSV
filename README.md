Snowman - Structural Variation detection by String Graph Assembly
=================================================================

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwalabroad/SnowmanSV/master/figures/labels_sm.png" width="200">

Snowman is a method for detecting structural variations in whole genome sequencing data, using a custom application of the SGA string graph assembly algorithm. Snowman was designed to work with cancer genomes, but is able to call both somatic and germline variants.
