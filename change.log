#snowman 67
-- loosened the filters a bit, to be more sensitive to low AF	
# snowman 68
-- fixed bug with complex events, and with not doing discordant lookup for
inter-chr events
# snowman 69
-- slighlty more permissive on complex breaks	
# snowman 70
-- no dedup calc for non rule pass (improved memory and speed performance)	
# snowman 71
-- changed to a global one-read-name-per-split-coverage rule. Previously
only applied to SVs > 1000	
# snowman 72
-- fixed missing printed contig name in AlignedContig
-- added local check for assembly-only. non-locals are ditched
-- added dup-read check, which checks r2c alignments to get span of split
read covs. Ditches the variant as DUPREADS if split span is same < read
length
-- moved fail-safe warning (10,000 read max per region) to log file
# snowman 73
-- fixed bug that make the dupreads fix from snowman72 not work	
# snowman 74
##-- more strict in dup reads. Now, required that split coverage spans
##read_len + 13 bases
-- exit_code for "help" switched to 0 (from 1)	
-- bug that let PCR duplicate reads though (bad minirules
expression). Fixed
-- added check that both the first and second mate of a pair cannot
contribtue to same break. If so, reject all reads with that qname	
-- fixed bug that was causing reads to not be trimmed correctly in
MiniReads
-- added refiltering of complex events	

## snowman 75
-- greatly reduced the cutoff for calling reads somatic (DBCUTOFF 15 -> 7,
NODBCUTOFF 8 -> 2.5

	## snowman 76
	-- fixed bug that allowed contigs with a high number (3+) of
	secondary alignmetns to make it to the filtered VCFs
	-- require 50 bases match min per alignmetn for contisg with < 0.2
	AF
	-- prevents indels from being called if part of something like
	50M3D8M9I 
	-- fixed bug that only counted repeats in one direction for indels
	-- added ability to pass single chr string to -k (e.g. snowman run
	-k 1)
	-- added contig-wide repeat filter (for super long repeats) in BreakPoint::repeatFilter


	## snowman 77
	-- fixed bug that didn't filter out 50 bases match min from (76)
	-- added filter for inter-chr assembly-only that need to have all
	pieces 60+ for non-complex
	-- added -- else if (num_align == 2 && std::min(b1.mapq, b2.mapq) <
	50 && b1.gr.chr != b2.gr.chr) // interchr need good mapq for
	assembly only
	-- added blacklist check for assembly-only
	-- set default NM to - for reduced breakend
	-- added discorand read counts to ALT for DSCR
	-- fixed bug that was throwing out indels at DBSNP sites (due to
	bad AF frac calculation)
	-- added blat option
	-- added refilter option
	-- fixed bug that forced all DSCRD to be intra-chromosomal
	-- post-pend contig names with C to make them unique when grepping
	-- fixed bug that under-estimated LOD for indels
	-- added cname to discordants.txt.gz output
	-- added info header tags to indel
	-- allow for germline/somatic classification to be skipped for
	single BAM files
	-- turned off error printing for MT chr in DBSNP filter
	-- fixed bug in discordants with extra "x" in read names and blank
	for contigs (should be 'x')
	-- fix error where ALT counts for DSCRD clusters not being
	reported in bps
	-- got rid of dup read names for read tracking in DSCRD / ASDIS case
	-- added filter to get rid of germline events with low AF

	## snowman 78
	-- added BOOST to LD_PATH for FH task
	-- allow local parts of complex breaks, and will check them
	against discordant reads
	-- fixed NaN bug on log-likelihood calc
	-- removed bug where somatic SVs were being later set to germline
	because they were at site of low-confidence germline indel. Made
	it now for indels only, and requires PASS germline indel
	-- got rid of bug where normal reads aligning fulling to one
	contig alignment were counting as split when they aligned in a
	homology region
	-- more persmissive for ASDIS with secondary alignments. if strong
	discordant cluster (with high MAPQ and 10+ reads) then keep
	-- fixed toFileString bug in discordant cluster

	## snowman 79
	-- slightly stricter on assmebly only for short (4+ now)
	-- slogihtly stricter on cliped reads for insertions (16bp or more
	now required to be supported by only one side spanned by clip)

	## snowman 80
	-- fixed issue where high quality gemrline indels were being
	rejected because of a sign error on the LR caclulation 
	-- fixed issue where germline indels were being called somatic if
	there were multiple alleles at one location. This was from r2c
	mappings being thrown out too quickly if they had any indel vs the
	contig. Now they are parsed and only removed if indel exactly
	mirrors the variant (e.g. 40I on a contig with a 40D is not valid)
	-- removed 5+ split read filtered required for inter-chr ASDIS
	-- fixed bug where small non-FR pairs not being picked up (caused
	false negative short DUPS)
	-- relaxed other read rules (10->5 clip, no mapq filter)
	-- fixed bug where discordant clusters being reported incorrectly
	in file

	## snowman 81
	-- fixed error in how some indels are parsed

	## snowman 82
	-- turned off over-aggressive DB snp filter for events iwth AF <
	0.2 nearby a DBsnp site

	## snowman 84
	-- added multi-round jumping for complex events
	-- reinstated bootstrap assembly
	-- added gap-open penalty option

	## snowman 85
	-- decreased strictness of the contig length cutoff (115% of read length)

	## snomwan 86
	-- turned off debug printing
	-- added gap extension penalty option

	## snowman 87
	-- fixed issue where discordant clusters were not being reported
	   if they weren't being looked up. E.g. normal clusters
	   that are informative were not being recorded

	## snowman 88
	-- fixed assert statments releative to v87 that were causing failure

	## snowman 89
	-- moved to JSON rules
	-- forgot a "use Samtools" statement in snow.sh

	## snowman 90
	-- more strict about do too many jumps to mate regions

	## snowman 91
	-- removed hard limit on read lookups in mate window that was
	giving 0 coverage issues

	## snowman 92
	-- loosened filters on DSCRD, strengthed on ASDIS
	-- fixed bug with over-counting split and disc from same qnameg

	## snowman 93
	-- added NM filter for assembly only
	-- fixed bug with somatic svs being removed by random weird
	germline events nearby
	-- fixed issue where we weren't checking orientation of BPs and
	DCs when looking for overlap
	-- allow ASDISC with lots of disc reads but few split reads
	-- synced ASDISC filter for MAPQ so that something that passes
	DSCRD would also pass ASDISC. Previously, would fail something
	with an assembly mapq of < 10, even if disc cluster was
	high-confidence
	-- fixed bug where germline indels that fell at same point as a
	PASS somatic SV were being used to mark it as germline
	(inappropriate cross talk between INDEL and SV)
	-- switched to MEDIAN score in DiscordantCluster, instead of MEAN
	-- don't count RF reads if insert is near size of read length
	-- filter out discordant pairs in clusters that deviate
	substantially from the other pairs. Fixes issue where small insert
	RF pairs in normal were being group with larger insert RF pairs in
	tumor, causing false negative somatic calls.
	-- fixed issue with some wonky discordant read clusters where L
	and R clusters overlapped (set them to invalid)
	-- removed one round of assembly, second round is exact
	-- removed SOMATIC info field from VCF
	-- dont print READNAMES if equal to 'x'
	-- minor bug where local breaks between two non-secondary mappings
	were being called as secondary because of a non-reset bp.secondary
	flag from a previous local breakpoint
	-- added a << method for break-end for easier debugging
	-- added 'reuse' method for faster debugging
	-- dont count secondary reads when getting coverage
	-- add a pad of 10 when deduplicating rearrangements in vcf.cpp
